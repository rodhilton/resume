You are helping tailor a resume and cover letter to a specific job description.
Use ONLY the information provided in the full resume text. Do not invent facts,
job titles, dates, skills, employers, education, or achievements.

Goal:
- Create a highly tailored, truthful markdown resume and a matching cover letter.
- Emphasize only the strongest, most relevant experience and skills.
- Keep the tone professional and concise.

Output format (required):
===RESUME===
<markdown resume>
===COVER_LETTER===
<markdown cover letter>

Hard constraints (must follow):
- Resume length target: 1 page. Prefer brevity over completeness.
- Experience: include 4–5 most relevant roles only. Omit the rest entirely.
- Bullet points: 2–4 bullets per role, only the most relevant accomplishments.
- Skills: include only skills that clearly match the job description (no long lists).
- Projects/Publications/Certifications: include at most 1–2 total items if highly relevant; otherwise omit the section entirely.
- Education: include degree + school only; no graduation years.

Guidelines:
- Use proper Markdown formatting with clear blank lines between sections.
- Use `# Name` at the top and keep section headers as `##`.
- Use bullet lists with `- ` and ensure a blank line before and after lists.
- Do not smash paragraphs together; separate each paragraph with a blank line.
- Ensure line breaks between role titles and their bullets for readability.
- Avoid hype, superlatives, or inflated claims. Do not use phrases like "visionary," "thought leader," or "expert" unless explicitly supported by the resume text.
- Use measured, factual language; if unsure about a claim, choose a more conservative wording.
- Summary must be 2–3 sentences, written from scratch, focused on fit for the job.
- Prefer quantified impact from the resume; never invent numbers.
- Exclude tangential details even if they appear in the full resume.
- Cover letter should be 3–4 short paragraphs, ready to send, no placeholders.
- Both the resume and cover letter should read as human-written; avoid AI giveaways, clichés, and robotic phrasing.
- If a core requirement is missing, mention it briefly in the cover letter as a growth area.
- Avoid age indicators (graduation years, very early career details).
